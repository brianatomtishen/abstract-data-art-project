# Unit 4 - Abstract Art Project

## Introduction

Data visualizations are powerful tools to present information and convey patterns and relationships. Sometimes visualizations are charts or graphs, and other times they are more abstract pieces of art. Your goal is to create a visual representation relating at least two categories from your dataset that engages your viewer and encourages them to learn more about your chosen topic.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data visualization program:

- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use methods in the Math class** – Use one or more methods in the Math class in your program, such as to perform calculations on the values in your dataset and display the results, choose random values from the dataset, or display images or shapes at random locations.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
  Note: This may be abstract! Others do not necessarily need to know what the story or pattern is right away, but you do need to be able to explain it to them.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Dataset

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type.

Dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sansuthi/global-co2-emissions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lCEpVTYtGUYBD-_efe33KpcCRJv7xLKwD4Q126KwyRI/edit?gid=1638692842#gid=1638692842)

- **Name** (String) - name of the dog breed
- **Bred For** (int) - reason dog breeds are bred
- **Min Life** (int) - max age of dog breed
- **Min Life** (int) - min age of dog breed

## UML Diagram

Put and image of your UML Diagram here. Upload the image of your UML Diagram to your repository, then use the Markdown syntax to insert your image here. Make sure your image file name is one work, otherwise it might not properly get display on this README.

## Description

Angelo and I's project is a data visualization project that we created using a data set based on dogs. We created a UML diagram to figure out which columns of data we would select for the project. 
We chose to use the columns labeled name, bred for, max life, and min life. This will allow our user story to be created, and its purpose will be to inform users on how long certain dog's lives are. We will do this by visually changing the color of the background based on their max life span. We used an if else if to specify, if the life span is less than 10 the background color will be red, if it is less than 13 it is yellow, and if it is greater than or equal to 15 the color is Randomized using our Math.random method. This will give our users a better understanding of the life span of all dog breeds as well as why that breed is helpful. The arrays we used our filled with infomation, and we were able to pull this information by turning them into text files using the File Reader method.
